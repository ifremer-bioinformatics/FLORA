# FLORA: Output

This document describes the output produced by the workflow.

## Intermediate results

During the workflow, intermediate files are generated and correspond in particular:
- to the mapping analysis

You can find these files in the process workdir **`flora_workdir/[projectName]/[process_hash]`**.

## Final results

FLORA guides you and simplifies the post-workflow analysis in particular by publishing only final necessary files.

All of these files are available in **`$PWD/results/[projectName]/02_final_results`**.
